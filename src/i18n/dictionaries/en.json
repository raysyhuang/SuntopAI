On this foundation, we developed our proprietary dialysis management system, making all core equipment—dialysis machines, BP monitors, scales—IoT-enabled, and integrating customized models and decision systems to achieve a complete closed loop from data collection, analysis, evaluation, recommendations to real-time feedback.",
        "Today, we have 30+ self-operated dialysis centers and 100+ partner centers nationwide, with 50+ successfully upgraded to smart dialysis centers and 3,000+ connected dialysis devices. Our system continuously provides clinical decision support during treatment—including intradialytic hypotension alerts, UF rate optimization recommendations, and dry weight assessments. These insights are embedded in real-time within the physician's workflow, not as post-hoc analysis.",
        "We believe truly valuable healthcare innovation must simultaneously improve medical quality, reduce risk, and increase operational efficiency. Suntop Healthcare is driving the transformation of dialysis management from 'experience-driven' to 'data-driven', making dialysis safer, more efficient, and more sustainable."
